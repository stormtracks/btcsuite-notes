Logging in btcd is supported by:

https://github.com/cihub/seelog

which was forked and then a bit more functionality was added:

https://github.com/btcsuite/btclog

Out of the box the following subsystem loggers show logging information
in the normal course of running the node.

{AMGR, BMGR, BTCD, DISC, RPCS, SRVR}

see **config.go** for more details on logging

stay tuned as I will add more info on how to set subsystem loggers
